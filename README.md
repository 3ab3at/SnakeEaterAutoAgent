# Snake Eater

## Description

Automatic ML model for playing Snake Eater. 
The game implementation was last modified in January 2024 by Jos√© Carlos Pulido for the Machine Learning Classes at the University Carlos III of Madrid.

## Features

- Automatic snake movement based on BFS algorithm.
- Extract Features from the game to train models to play the game using Weka.
- Training of different ML models to play the game `Play.py` (currently j48.model)
- Regression models for predicting snake movements and score `Predict.py`
- Colorful graphical interface.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Python and PyGame installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run `python Play.py` to start the game with the j48 model playing.
4. Run `Predict.py` to start the regression model for score prediction.
